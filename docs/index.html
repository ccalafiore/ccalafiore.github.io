<h2>Profession</h2>
<p>He is a PhD student in Psychology and Computer Science at the University of Essex.</p>

<h2>Online Experiments</h2>
<p>This website contains the following 10 online tests. These were made to study the passive action recognition, the active action recognition and the visual perspective taking in humans:</p>
