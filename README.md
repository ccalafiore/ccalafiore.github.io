This repository builds a website running several online tests for research in passive and the active action recognition of humans. You can visit the main page at [https://ccalafiore.github.io](https://ccalafiore.github.io). The main page shows the list of all tests.

A similar tool can be used to ask people to annotate visual data for deep learning.
